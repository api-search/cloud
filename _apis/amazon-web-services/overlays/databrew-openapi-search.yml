        version does not exist.</p> </li> <li> <p>A version is being used by a
        job.</p> </li> <li> <p>You specify <code>LATEST_WORKING</code>, but it's

        deleted.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>LATEST_WORKING</code> version will
        only be deleted if the recipe has no other versions. If you try to
        delete <code>LATEST_WORKING</code> while other versions exist (or if
        they can't be deleted), then <code>LATEST_WORKING</code> will be listed
        as partial failure in the response.</p>
