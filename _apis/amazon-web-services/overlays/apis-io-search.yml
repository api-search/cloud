    description: >-
      The IAM Access Analyzer API provides a set of tools to help users manage
      their Identity and Access Management policies effectively. This includes
      features such as identifying external and unused access, conducting basic
      and custom policy checks, and generating fine-grained policies. 


      To use IAM Access Analyzer, users must first create an analyzer to
      identify potential risks and access issues. External access analyzers help
      identify resources with policies granting access to external principals,
      while unused access analyzers highlight unused IAM roles, access keys, and
      permissions. 


      IAM Access Analyzer also offers policy validation checks and the ability
      to refine permissions by generating policies based on CloudTrail logs.
      This guide outlines the various operations that can be performed
      programmatically with IAM Access Analyzer. For more information, refer to
      the IAM User Guide.

    description: >-
      <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API
      Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
      each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a
      private certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The
      documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the
      JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
      platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
      SDKs</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a
      quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per
      second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different
      rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web
      Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request
      exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When
      a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
      error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
      rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web
      Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your
      Amazon Web Services account and visit the <a
      href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a>

  - name: Amazon Application Configuration
    description: >-
      <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to
      create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig
      supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes
      built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
      applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile
      applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying
      application configurations, especially for production systems where a
      simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes
      validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure
      that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate
      your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web
      Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The
      configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration
      data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig
      monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If
      the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to
      minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment
      strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment
      criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to
      error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig
      automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig
      supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a
      timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li>
      <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce
      changes to your application that can only be tested with production
      traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow
      premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your
      application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
      system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the

    description: >-
      <p>AppConfig Data provides the data plane APIs your application uses to
      retrieve configuration data. Here's how it works:</p> <p>Your application
      retrieves configuration data by first establishing a configuration session
      using the AppConfig Data <a>StartConfigurationSession</a> API action. Your
      session's client then makes periodic calls to
      <a>GetLatestConfiguration</a> to check for and retrieve the latest data
      available.</p> <p>When calling <code>StartConfigurationSession</code>,
      your code sends the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identifiers
      (ID or name) of an AppConfig application, environment, and configuration
      profile that the session tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) The minimum
      amount of time the session's client must wait between calls to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In response,
      AppConfig provides an <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> to be given
      to the session's client and used the first time it calls
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> for that session.</p> <important>
      <p>This token should only be used once in your first call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>. You <i>must</i> use the new token in
      the <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> response
      (<code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>) in each subsequent call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </important> <p>When calling
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>, your client code sends the most
      recent <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value it has and receives in
      response:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>: the
      <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value to use on the next call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>NextPollIntervalInSeconds</code>: the duration the client should
      wait before making its next call to <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.
      This duration may vary over the course of the session, so it should be
      used instead of the value sent on the
      <code>StartConfigurationSession</code> call.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
      configuration: the latest data intended for the session. This may be empty
      if the client already has the latest version of the configuration.</p>
      </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> and
      <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code> should only be used once. To
      support long poll use cases, the tokens are valid for up to 24 hours. If a
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> call uses an expired token, the system
      returns <code>BadRequestException</code>.</p> </important> <p>For more
      information and to view example CLI commands that show how to retrieve a
      configuration using the AppConfig Data

  - name: 'AWS Zonal Shift '
    description: >-
      Explore the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53
      Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC), where you can initiate a
      zonal shift to redirect traffic for a load balancer resource away from a
      specific Availability Zone to aid in swift application recovery. This
      feature is useful for addressing issues such as faulty code deployments or
      infrastructure failures within a single Availability Zone on Amazon Web
      Services.


      Moreover, you can benefit from zonal autoshift, a function within Route 53
      ARC that automatically diverts application traffic from an affected
      Availability Zone to expedite recovery during critical events. Amazon Web
      Services proactively manages the traffic redirection for resources enabled
      for zonal autoshift when potential issues in an Availability Zone are
      identified.


      To ensure the safety and effectiveness of zonal autoshift for your
      application, it is essential to configure practice runs when enabling this
      feature for a resource. These practice runs facilitate regular zonal
      shifts for the resource, ensuring there is sufficient capacity in all
      Availability Zones within an Amazon Web Services Region to maintain normal
      operation in case of traffic redirection.


      It is important to prescale resource capacity in all relevant Availability
      Zones before implementing practice runs or enabling zonal autoshift, as
      relying on demand-based scaling during these processes is not recommended.
      For detailed guidance on utilizing zonal shift and zonal autoshift,
      consult the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer
      Guide.

      any source in your hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS
      applications hosted on-premises or in the cloud, virtual machines, or
      containers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action
      on this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting
      tools. After you run <code>PutAuditEvents</code> to ingest your
      application activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to
      search, query, and analyze the data that is logged from your
      applications.</p>

      <p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with
      language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache
      Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with
      development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both
      public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream
      relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository,
      which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a
      package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p>
      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A
      CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version">package
      versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files.
      Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of
      any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and
      publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI,
      the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b>
      <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs
      (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity
      known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in
      the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset,
      such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many
      repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain
      are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key
      Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single
      domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows
      organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as
      which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public
      repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an
      organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production
      domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and
      share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata
      required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact
      supports <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html">npm</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html">PyPI</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven">Maven</a>,
      and <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget">NuGet</a>
      package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a
      popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example,
      <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set
      of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>,
      <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for
      example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>:
      A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The
      version number format and semantics vary for different package formats.
      For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a
      href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In
      CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier,
      metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of
      another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the
      repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the
      contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client.
      CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two
      repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored
      in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm
      <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external
      connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one
      repository to another repository in the same domain.</p> </li> <li> <p>

      repository. </p> </li> <li> <p>

      <p>CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application
      deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your
      own facility, serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon
      ECS service.</p> <p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of
      application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated
      applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files,
      executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. CodeDeploy
      can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub
      repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes
      to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.</p> <p>CodeDeploy
      makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid
      downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of
      updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
      error-prone manual deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Components</b> </p>
      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that
      uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses
      this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct
      combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group
      are referenced during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment
      group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment
      configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A
      Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of
      a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service
      created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to
      reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An
      Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged
      instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or
      both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and
      rollback settings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A
      set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used
      by CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a
      containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing
      content on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application
      revisions</b>: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that
      specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to
      validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this
      is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition,
      container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an
      EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source
      content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment
      scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3
      buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely
      identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For
      GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details
      about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances
      available for CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda
      function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service
      deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Information Resources</b> </p> <ul>

      <fullname>CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the
      CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the
      actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for your
      pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodePipeline
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the CodePipeline API to work with
      pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are
      models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named,
      and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p> <p>You can work
      with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which
      creates a uniquely named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline
      structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource
      Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns
      information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state
      of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListActionExecutions</a>, which returns action-level details for past
      executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
      including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred
      during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.</p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the
      pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent
      executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the most recent revision of an
      artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StopPipelineExecution</a>, which stops the specified pipeline execution
      from continuing through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to
      the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include
      <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete
      before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a
      stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
      either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a
      user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline.
      You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a
      pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
      <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline,
      including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the
      structure of stages and actions, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">CodePipeline
      Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include
      <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or
      build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use
      a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as
      Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most
      cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with
      pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>Source</p> </li> <li> <p>Build</p> </li> <li> <p>Test</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Deploy</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval</p> </li> <li> <p>Invoke</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the
      transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the
      actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by
      calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents
      artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of
      artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the
      API to integrate with CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators
      or developers who want to create their own integrations with CodePipeline,
      the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with
      CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:</p> <p>
      <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a
      source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p>
      <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received
      the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns
      the details of a job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which
      determines whether there are any jobs to act on.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure. </p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
      success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances
      of an action created by a partner action and integrated into CodePipeline.
      Partner actions are created by members of the Amazon Web Services Partner
      Network.</p> <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job
      worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a
      partner action.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which
      determines whether there are any jobs to act on. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job
      failure.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which
      provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul>

      <fullname>AWS CodeStar Connections</fullname> <p>This Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage
      examples of the operations and data types for the Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with
      connections and installations.</p> <p> <i>Connections</i> are
      configurations that you use to connect Amazon Web Services resources to
      external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be
      given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party
      repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in
      CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made
      to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
      associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>
      <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party
      connection handshake. <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to
      conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket
      provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can
      choose an existing installation or create one.</p> <p>When you want to
      create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub
      Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections.</p>
      <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that
      can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the
      connection, including the connection status.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your
      account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can work with hosts by calling:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p> <a>CreateHost</a>, which creates a host that represents the
      infrastructure where your provider is installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteHost</a>, which deletes the specified host.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetHost</a>, which returns information about the host, including the
      setup status.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListHosts</a>, which lists the hosts
      associated with your account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can work with tags in
      Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections by calling the following:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a>, which gets information about
      Amazon Web Services tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in
      Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>TagResource</a>, which adds or updates tags for a resource in Amazon
      Web Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UntagResource</a>, which removes tags for a resource in Amazon Web
      Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about
      how to use Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections, see the <a

      <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname> <p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides
      an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
      application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available
      for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data
      locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer
      credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the
      service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
      credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB
      of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
      identity.</p> <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each
      identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity. In
      order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using
      credentials retrieved with <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Cognito Identity service</a>.</p> <p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an
      Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via
      the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer
      Guide for Android</a> and the <a

      Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary

      Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more
      third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or
      an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
      unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier
      for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security

      ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus
      on processing the data.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR
      implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS
      Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management
      scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data analysis
      using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline
      Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to
      provide custom data management.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline implements two
      main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline and
      define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be
      performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner application
      to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for performing
      the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting
      the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner.
      The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
      reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is
      done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to
      the web service.</p>

      <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to
      help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
      Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts
      time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic
      from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs.
      It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The
      Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
      graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
      accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.</p>
      <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator
      account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the
      invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
      management account designates the Detective administrator account for the
      organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the
      organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also
      the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.</p>
      <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account
      as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization
      accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account
      can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
      to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated
      with the currently selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for
      a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior
      graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The
      organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
      delegated administrator for Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator
      account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the
      following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Perform all of the functions of an
      administrator account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine whether to
      automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the
      organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An invited member account
      can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>View the
      list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accept
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decline
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove
      their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API actions
      are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging
      Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the
      term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
      administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In
      the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in
      their behavior graph.</p> </note>

      Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to

      integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
      details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services
      Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or
      Application Discovery Agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application
      discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
      Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database
      using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data
      into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications
      with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows
      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use
      one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to
      the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
      information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
      Services SDKs</a>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Remember that you must set your
      Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
      associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a
      <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
      permitted outside of your home Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is
      unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs
      outside the home Region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
      returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to
      obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.</p> </li> </ul> </note>

      <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to
      create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
      data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
      two snapshots. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers
      backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient
      and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes
      through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
      from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
      instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental
      snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use
      for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots,
      you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then
      after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or
      on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain
      complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API
      reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
      parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about
      the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use

      <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname> <p>A load balancer distributes
      incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables
      you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer
      also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it
      routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer
      to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
      configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
      the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port
      number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with
      health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
      targets.</p> <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of
      load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers,
      Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers
      the following load balancer types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Application Load
      Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP
      and HTTPS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the
      transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p>

      <p>Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon
      Web Services resources. When your resources change state, they
      automatically send events to an event stream. You can create rules that
      match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take
      action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule.
      For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically
      invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you
      that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li>

      <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features
      by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out
      the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help
      you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce
      risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the
      feature.</p> <p>You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature
      design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as
      many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and
      analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear
      recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both
      user-facing features and backend features.</p>

      <fullname>Global Accelerator</fullname> <p>This is the <i>Global
      Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need
      detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and
      errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in
      which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your
      applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of
      accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li>
      <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your
      internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
      accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over
      the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other
      scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom
      routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or
      more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul>
      <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports
      endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the
      US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with
      accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region
      us-west-2</code> on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.</p> </important>
      <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses
      that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are
      anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global
      Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global
      Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses
      and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4,
      instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can
      configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address
      ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a
      standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across
      multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions ,
      which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for
      standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load
      Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located
      in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions.
      For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the
      static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are
      virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP
      addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists,
      even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
      traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the
      static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route
      traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions
      with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete
      an accelerator. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based
      policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global
      Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic
      to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and
      policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in
      health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is
      always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about
      understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>

      <p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that
      analyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC flow
      logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3
      data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, runtime
      activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS
      (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2 instances. It uses
      threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and
      machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and
      malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can
      include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed
      credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of
      malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example,
      GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances and container workloads
      serving malware, or mining bitcoin. </p> <p>GuardDuty also monitors Amazon
      Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as
      unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a
      Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password
      policy change to reduce password strength. </p> <p>GuardDuty informs you
      about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing
      security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through
      Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see the <i> <a

      <fullname>Health</fullname> <p>The Health API provides access to the
      Health information that appears in the <a
      href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home">Health Dashboard</a>. You
      can use the API operations to get information about events that might
      affect your Amazon Web Services and resources.</p> <p>You must have a
      Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services
      Support</a> to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an
      Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise
      On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
      <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p> <p>For API access,
      you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary
      credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary
      credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security
      token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">Best
      practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the
      <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>You can use the
      Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the Health
      API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture
      and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can
      use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web
      Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from
      the API. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing
      the Health API</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For
      authentication of requests, Health uses the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>If your Amazon Web Services account
      is part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational view
      feature. This feature provides a centralized view of Health events across
      all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate Health events in real
      time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an
      operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the
      organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event
      information. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
      Health events</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>When you
      use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following
      recommendations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode">eventScopeCode</a>
      parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or
      account-specific.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use pagination to view all events from
      the response. For example, if you call the
      <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in
      your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
      <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.</p>
      </li> </ul> </note>

      <p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs —
      remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices
      connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a
      set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates,
      reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
      operations.</p> <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a
      description of the remote operations to be performed, and you specify a
      list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be
      individual things, thing groups or both.</p> <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a
      message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts
      the execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the
      operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs
      service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific
      target and for all the targets of the job</p>

      <p>Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how
      internet issues impact the performance and availability between your
      applications hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can
      reduce the time it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to
      minutes. Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web
      Services captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a
      baseline of performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the
      same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and
      availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor
      raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your end
      users in the different geographic locations where your application
      runs.</p> <p>Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to
      CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch
      tools with health information for geographies and networks specific to
      your application. Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon
      EventBridge so that you can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by
      the Amazon Web Services network, you also automatically receive an Amazon
      Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web
      Services is taking to mitigate the problem.</p> <p>To use Internet
      Monitor, you create a <i>monitor</i> and associate your application's
      resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces
      directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's
      internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements
      from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs
      (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your
      application.</p> <p>For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html">Using
      Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User

      <p>IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data,
      process messages, and store them. You can then query the data and run
      sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data
      exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data
      visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight.</p>
      <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to
      process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record
      noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the
      data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and
      false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also,
      IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from
      external sources. </p> <p>IoT Analytics automates the steps required to
      analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and
      enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for
      analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need
      from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and
      enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and
      location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running
      queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex
      analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built
      models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which
      devices are about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning
      their wearable devices.</p>

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web
      Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both
      requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web
      Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS
      HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i>
      <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p>
      <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html">
      Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about
      your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">
      Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> —
      Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a
      channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream.
      See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a
      channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey
      endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret,
      since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using
      playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback
      key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the
      playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores
      configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the
      recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording
      configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback restriction policy</b> —
      Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites. See the Playback
      Restriction Policy endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to
      an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a
      <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as
      <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including
      restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements";
      Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented
      there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web
      Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different
      resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to
      manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">
      Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging:
      Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording
      Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p>
      <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be
      authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization
      is needed to view <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon
      IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled
      for "playback authorization.")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b>
      </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a
      signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon
      IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you.
      However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your
      responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using
      valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the
      requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a
      signature generated from a user account that has the
      <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code> permission.</p> <p>For more information:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Channel
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateChannel</a> — Creates a new
      channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <a>GetChannel</a> — Gets the channel configuration for the specified
      channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetChannel</a> — Performs
      <a>GetChannel</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListChannels</a> — Gets summary information about all channels in your
      account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is
      processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or
      recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be
      used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409
      Conflict Exception).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateChannel</a> — Updates a

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      real-time API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS
      EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and
      responses, including errors. </p> <p>Terminology:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A
      <i>stage</i> is a virtual space where participants can exchange video in
      real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <i>participant token</i> is a token that
      authenticates a participant when they join a stage.</p> </li> <li> <p>A
      <i>participant object</i> represents participants (people) in the stage
      and contains information about them. When a token is created, it includes
      a participant ID; when a participant uses that token to join a stage, the
      participant is associated with that participant ID. There is a 1:1 mapping
      between participant tokens and participants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server-side
      composition: The <i>composition</i> process composites participants of a
      stage into a single video and forwards it to a set of outputs (e.g., IVS
      channels). Composition endpoints support this process.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Server-side composition: A <i>composition</i> controls the look of the
      outputs, including how participants are positioned in the video.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain
      information about your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/RealTimeUserGuide/getting-started.html">Getting
      Started with Amazon IVS Real-Time Streaming</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Stage</b> — A stage is a virtual space where participants can exchange
      video in real time.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A
      <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
      comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example,
      you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular
      video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS stages has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS real-time API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resource supports tagging:
      Stage.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.</p> <p>

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API
      enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need
      to integrate with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">
      Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API</a>, to enable users to interact with chat
      rooms in real time.</p> <p>The API is an AWS regional service. For a list
      of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the
      Amazon IVS Chat information on the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>Notes on
      terminology:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>You create service applications using
      the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as <i>applications</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>You create front-end client applications (browser and
      Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to
      these as <i>clients</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The
      following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>LoggingConfiguration</b> — A configuration that allows customers to
      store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging
      Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Room</b> — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients
      connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a
      metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a
      <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set
      a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category.
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:
      <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>.
      The following resource supports tagging: Room.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can
      be applied to a resource.</p> <p> <b>API Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your
      Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be
      authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
      IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
      create using the <a>CreateChatToken</a> endpoint through the AWS SDK. You
      call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and
      authorization information about the user.</p> <p> <b>Signing API
      Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4
      signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line
      Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API
      calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP
      API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You
      generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has
      permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage
      requests must be made using an IAM role that has the
      <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For more
      information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures —
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p>
      <b>Messaging Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMessage</a> — Sends
      an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific
      message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s

      Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra
      workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the
      Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code, you can
      create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any
      infrastructure or installing software. </p> <p>In addition to supporting
      Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers,
      Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to
      manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as
      well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such as
      CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported

      <p>AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between
      internet-connected wireless devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both
      LoRaWAN and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These
      wireless devices use the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN)
      communication protocol to communicate with AWS IoT.</p> <p>Using the API,
      you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations for your
      wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and profiles. After onboarding
      your devices, you can use the API operations to set log levels and monitor
      your devices with CloudWatch.</p> <p>You can also use the API operations
      to create multicast groups and schedule a multicast session for sending a
      downlink message to devices in the group. By using Firmware Updates
      Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can create a FUOTA task and
      schedule a session to update the firmware of individual devices or an
      entire group of devices in a multicast group.</p>

    description: >-
      <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service
      (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide
      describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
      general information about KMS, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key
      Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has
      replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and
      <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes,
      KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services
      provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
      programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android,
      etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
      KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take
      care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
      retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web
      Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
      </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make
      programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2
      validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web
      Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services
      Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service
      endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web
      Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed
      and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends
      you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support
      cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).
      Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p>
      <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access
      key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use
      your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key
      for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for
      an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate
      temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All
      KMS requests must be signed with <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports
      CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related
      events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon
      S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
      CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
      request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
      including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more
      information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html">Amazon

      <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
      log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then
      retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch
      console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon
      Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.</p> <p>You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Monitor logs from EC2
      instances in real time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor
      applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can
      track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it
      can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
      threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for
      monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor
      application logs for specific literal terms (such as
      "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of
      a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status
      codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is
      found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
      specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You
      can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular
      API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to
      perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage.
      You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier
      than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent
      helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
      and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you
      need it.</p> </li> </ul>

      types may only apply in the context of one framework and not the other.
      For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such as
      <code>CreateMember</code> and <code>DeleteMember</code> don't apply to
      Ethereum.</p> <p>The description for each action indicates the framework
      or frameworks to which it applies. Data types and properties that apply

      <p>AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to
      find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to
      build solutions and run their businesses. The AWS Marketplace Agreement
      Service provides an API interface that helps AWS Marketplace sellers
      manage their product-related agreements, including listing, searching, and
      filtering agreements.</p> <p>To manage agreements in AWS Marketplace, you
      must ensure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
      and roles are set up. The user must have the required policies/permissions
      that allow them to carry out the actions in AWS:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <code>DescribeAgreement</code> – Grants permission to users to obtain
      detailed meta data about any of their agreements.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>GetAgreementTerms</code> – Grants permission to users to obtain
      details about the terms of an agreement.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>SearchAgreements</code> – Grants permission to users to search
      through all their agreements.</p> </li> </ul>

      <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname> <p>This reference
      provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service
      API.</p> <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data
      for custom usage dimensions.</p> <p>For information on the permissions you
      need to use this API, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
      Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS
      Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> </p> <p> <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
      </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>MeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for an
      AWS Marketplace product. <code>MeterUsage</code> is called from an EC2
      instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>BatchMeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for a set of
      customers. <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Accepting
      New Customers</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>ResolveCustomer</i> - Called by a
      SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
      website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration
      Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this
      API to obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the
      <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b> </p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace
      must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
      <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation for software entitlement and
      metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
      required to call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you can do so if you want
      to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on
      using the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
      Products</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> API calls
      are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the
      SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records
      with the <code>eventName</code> of <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>. You can
      also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see
      the <i> <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS

      <note> <p>This guide is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage
      resources in MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from May 2023. To get
      started with MediaPackage v2, create your MediaPackage resources. There
      isn't an automated process to migrate your resources from MediaPackage v1
      to MediaPackage v2. </p> <p>The names of the entities that you use to
      access this API, like URLs and ARNs, all have the versioning information
      added, like "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. If you used
      MediaPackage prior to this release, you can't use the MediaPackage v2 CLI
      or the MediaPackage v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1 resources.</p>
      <p>If you created resources in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand (VOD)
      workflows, and aren't looking to migrate to MediaPackage v2 yet, see the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/apireference/what-is.html">MediaPackage
      v1 Live API Reference</a>.</p> </note> <p>This is the AWS Elemental
      MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It describes all the MediaPackage
      API operations for live content in detail, and provides sample requests,
      responses, and errors for the supported web services protocols.</p> <p>We
      assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use MediaPackage
      via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the features
      and operations of MediaPackage, as described in the AWS Elemental
      MediaPackage User Guide.</p>

      interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune
      is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
      such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been
      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the

      observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts
      share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared
      observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in
      Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, and applications in Amazon
      CloudWatch Application Insights.</p>

      <p>This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API
      actions, data types, and errors. </p> <ul> <li> <p>The REST API requires
      you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling
      request retries, and error handling. For general information about using
      the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon
      Web Services APIs</a>. </p> <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST
      API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com
      </code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon
      Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming
      language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and
      step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall
      console, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network
      Firewall Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Network Firewall is a
      stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention
      service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network
      Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
      includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway,
      NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules
      that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis
      and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version
      6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a
      href="https://suricata.io/">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use
      Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of
      ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow
      domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints,
      such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain
      names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep
      packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS,
      regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall
      for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network
      Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User
      Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p>
      <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to
      protect, create it in Amazon VPC. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, in
      each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create
      a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p> </li> <li> <p>In
      Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the
      components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your
      firewall to have. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a
      firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional
      default traffic filtering behavior. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network
      Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC
      subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that
      you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route
      traffic through the new firewall endpoints.</p> </li> </ol>

      then specify <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can do this in the CLI by
      using these parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the following
      parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its
      region:</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url
      https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> <i>(from commercial

      Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the
      default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:</p>
      <p> <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> <i>(from
      commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p>
      <p>or</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1</code>
      <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use

      <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname> <p>AWS OpsWorks for configuration
      management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration
      management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS
      OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers,
      and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of
      terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management
      server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server
      runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use
      various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service
      (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over
      the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In
      AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create
      servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you
      want to use. Valid values in this release include
      <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the
      configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for
      backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of
      a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup
      starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a
      server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run,
      when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When
      you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are
      assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store
      information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your
      customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS
      OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect
      to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or
      managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li>

      <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage
      encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations.
      You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can
      also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For
      more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and access management</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment
      Cryptography User Guide.</i> </p> <p>To use encryption keys for
      payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic
      operations, you use the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane</a>. You can perform actions
      like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data.</p>
      <p>All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed
      and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you
      always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests. </p>
      <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for
      control plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API
      calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers
      them to an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information
      collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to
      Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it
      was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a trail, you can still view the
      most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see
      the <a

      messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint
      Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the
      email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint
      API.</p> <p>If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to
      also review the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon
      Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i>
      provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to
      use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon
      Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications.
      The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon
      Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to
      using the service.</p> <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in
      several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions.

      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">Proton
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b> </p> <p>When you make
      a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the
      asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might
      also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete,
      even if the request already returned a result. This might make it
      difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might
      need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation
      completes successfully. However, if the original request and the
      subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times.
      This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p>
      <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more
      than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action
      completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully
      without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain
      updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The
      following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure
      idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b>
      </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a
      <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands
      also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique,
      case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent
      API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the
      request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token
      for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these
      APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p>
      <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry
      succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the
      original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are
      different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens
      expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with
      the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original
      resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is
      created.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent
      create APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
      <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original
      resource <i>hasn't</i> been modified, the retry succeeds without
      performing any further actions other than returning the original resource
      detail data in the response.</p> <p>If the original resource has been
      modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p> <p>If you
      retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a
      <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Idempotent create
      APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironment</p> </li>
      <li> <p>CreateService</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b>
      </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry
      the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its

      instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance
      Insights data types, parameters and errors.</p> <p>When Performance
      Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides

      Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
      two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load
      data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point
      decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
      at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.</p>

      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
      next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster

      <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and
      discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your
      resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of
      resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
      instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon
      DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata
      like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the
      Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service
      on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p> <p>Resource Explorer
      scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your
      Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer.
      Resource Explorer <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
      and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that
      Region's resources.</p> <p>You can <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search
      across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one
      of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for
      the account. When you <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote
      a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the
      account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index
      information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator
      index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all
      resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on
      Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region
      include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.</p>
      <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer,
      including how to enable and configure the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>

      <p>Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
      your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run
      outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services
      credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you
      have for native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web
      Services resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage
      long-term credentials for workloads running outside of Amazon Web
      Services.</p> <p> To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509
      certificates issued by their certificate authority (CA). You register the
      CA with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between
      your public key infrastructure (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't
      manage your own PKI system, you can use Private Certificate Authority to
      create a CA and then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere.
      </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you
      can call programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html">IAM

      <p>Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as
      Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
      databases, and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using
      criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of
      resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share
      one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources
      based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,
      regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups
      enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in Amazon Web
      Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in
      Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let
      you quickly view a custom console in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
      that shows Config compliance and other monitoring data about member
      resources.</p> <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and
      specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the group have in

      <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide
      for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53
      ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover
      applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web
      Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a
      highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five
      redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or
      update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one
      routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one
      Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be
      aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you
      work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states
      in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon)
      Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter
      <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
      Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon
      Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API
      guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and
      update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing
      control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components
      (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery
      cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with
      routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li>

      <p>When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS
      resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver
      answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2
      instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs
      recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
      names.</p> <p>You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and
      your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:</p> <p> <b>Forward
      DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b> </p>
      <p>DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
      specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain
      names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records
      in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc">How
      DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Conditionally
      forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b> </p> <p>You
      can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
      instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward
      selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names
      for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and
      the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to
      forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com,
      acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match
      (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you
      specified in that rule. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network">How
      Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Like Amazon VPC,
      Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose
      whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound
      queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.</p>

      <p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
      provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the
      runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For
      example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to
      Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user
      request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the
      bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to
      elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust
      type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when
      you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your
      Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time

      Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of
      data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
      associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB
      provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A
      traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
      capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
      repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically
      simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and
      providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates
      the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
      performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within
      Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and
      pay only for what they use. </p> <p> Visit <a

      <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers
      and enterprises to quickly find
       and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
       see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of 
       all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category 
       keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. 
       You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, 
       configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
       within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
       AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
       code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
       For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
       GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
       experiences available:</p><ul>
       <li>
       <p>Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including
       source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. </p>
       <p>Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other
       developers, and publish new versions of applications. </p>

      <p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You
      can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from
      cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in
      your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an
      account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web
      Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally
      manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite
      existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you
      analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security
      posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the
      protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p> <p>The data lake
      is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you
      retain ownership over your data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates
      with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a
      user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake,
      CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls
      captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to
      the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
      continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including
      events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still
      view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history.
      Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the
      request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the
      request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional
      details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon
      Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the
      collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon
      Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the
      lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings.
      Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a
      standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
      (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can
      subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response
      and security data analytics.</p>

      <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security
      state in Amazon Web Services and helps you assess your Amazon Web Services
      environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p>
      <p>Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services
      accounts, Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and
      helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority
      security issues.</p> <p>To help you manage the security state of your
      organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These
      include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices
      (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance
      frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment
      Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute
      of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several
      security controls, each of which represents a security best practice.
      Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control
      findings to help you assess your compliance against security best
      practices.</p> <p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub
      also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon
      GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This
      gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related
      issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web
      Services and supported third-party products.</p> <p>Security Hub offers
      automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues.
      For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical
      findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the
      integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to
      specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API
      Reference</i>, provides information about the Security Hub API. This
      includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If
      you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
      <i>Security Hub User Guide</i> </a>. The user guide explains key concepts
      and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features.
      It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub
      with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with
      Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a
      current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon
      Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
      code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go,
      Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient,
      programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They
      also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
      requests automatically. For information about installing and using the
      Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
      Services</a>.</p> <p>With the exception of operations that are related to
      central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the
      Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
      Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any
      configuration or settings change that results from the operation is
      applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions,
      call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the
      change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling
      Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and
      all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central
      configuration terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User
      Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub
      API operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of
      1 request per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>GetFindings</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second. <code>BurstLimit</code>
      of 6 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p>

      <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of
      5 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p>All other operations -

      <fullname>Step Functions</fullname> <p>Step Functions is a service that
      lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and
      microservices using visual workflows.</p> <p>You can use Step Functions to
      build applications from individual components, each of which performs a
      discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change
      applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
      visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
      Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps
      when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the
      right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you
      can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.</p> <p>Step Functions manages
      operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is
      available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own
      servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can
      access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the
      <i> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">Step
      Functions Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p> <important> <p>If you use the Step
      Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make
      sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal
      case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action
      <code>startSyncExecution</code> and specify its parameter as
      <code>StateMachineArn</code>.</p> </important>

      <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
      a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM
      Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s
      access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM
      Identity Center.</p> <note> <p>IAM Identity Center uses the
      <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces.</p>
      </note> <p> <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you
      begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
      important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service
      works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently
      implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
      standard (<a
      href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)
      that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.
      </p> </li> <li> <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits
      OIDC access tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
      re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh and
      doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI version
      (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token
      refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure
      Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p> </li> <li>
      <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon
      Web Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user,
      not just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in
      this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token
      into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with
      IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a>
      in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
      is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User

      <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>.</p>

      Services Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need
      detailed information about the Amazon Web Services Support operations and
      data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases
      programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support API uses HTTP methods
      that return results in JSON format.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have
      a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the
      Amazon Web Services Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the Amazon
      Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business,
      Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the
      <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For
      information about changing your support plan, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services
      Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>You can also use the Amazon Web
      Services Support API to access features for <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">Trusted
      Advisor</a>. You can return a list of checks and their descriptions, get
      check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
      checks.</p> <p>You can manage your support cases with the following Amazon
      Web Services Support API operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The
      <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and
      <a>ResolveCase</a> operations create Amazon Web Services Support cases,
      retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
      <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and
      <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a> operations retrieve and add communications and
      attachments to Amazon Web Services Support cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
      <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations
      return Amazon Web Service names, service codes, service categories, and
      problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the
      <a>CreateCase</a> operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can also use the
      Amazon Web Services Support API to call the Trusted Advisor operations.

      Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
      SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is performed by
      a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves
      managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance

      <p>Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management service from
      Amazon Web Services. You can use Verified Permissions to manage
      permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those
      permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant
      access based on information about the users, resources, and requested
      actions. You can also evaluate additional information like group
      membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time
      of request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these
      permissions by letting you create and store authorization policies for
      your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise
      business systems.</p> <p>Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy
      language to express your permission requirements. Cedar supports both
      role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
      authorization models.</p> <p>For more information about configuring,
      administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your applications,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Verified Permissions User Guide</a>.</p> <p>For more information about the
      Cedar policy language, see the <a
      href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/">Cedar Policy Language Guide</a>.</p>
      <important> <p>When you write Cedar policies that reference principals,
      resources and actions, you can define the unique identifiers used for each
      of those elements. We strongly recommend that you follow these best
      practices:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Use values like universally unique
      identifiers (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.</b> </p>
      <p>For example, if user <code>jane</code> leaves the company, and you
      later let someone else use the name <code>jane</code>, then that new user
      automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still
      reference <code>User::"jane"</code>. Cedar can’t distinguish between the
      new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource
      identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never
      reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of
      the presence of an old identifier in a policy.</p> <p>Where you use a UUID
      for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment
      specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your
      policies easier to understand. For example: principal ==
      User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111", // alice</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive
      information as part of the unique identifier for your principals or
      resources.</b> These identifiers are included in log entries shared in
      CloudTrail trails.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <p>Several operations
      return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes. As new
      functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter
      of one operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense
      for the same parameter in a different operation. To help you understand
      the purpose of each, the following naming convention is used for the
      structures:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in
      <code>Detail</code> are used in <code>Get</code> operations.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Item</code> are used

      <fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the
      <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that
      you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the
      versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the
      prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version,
      because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used
      WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF
      resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web
      ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF
      Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
      </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to
      this version, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall
      that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an
      Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application
      Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner
      service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets
      you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services
      resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify,
      such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of
      query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the
      requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom
      response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed
      information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed
      information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed
      in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF
      endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you
      can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an
      Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an
      AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service,
      or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For
      Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for
      US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you
      can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's
      tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
      more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon
      Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF
      API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API
      provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following
      major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and
      regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you
      specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to
      <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You
      can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with
      a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass
      them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF
      places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each
      type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the
      maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>

      <p>The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for
      users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises
      file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory
      structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as
      modifications to the permissions of files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security:
      Support security applications are supported for users who have additional
      security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
      actions, along with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
      changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the
      necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates
      the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are
      supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose
      to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with
      CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical
      applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are
      Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use
      of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
      IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
      policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon
      WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the
      entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes,
