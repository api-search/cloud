    description: >-
      The IAM Access Analyzer API provides a set of tools to help users manage
      their Identity and Access Management policies effectively. This includes
      features such as identifying external and unused access, conducting basic
      and custom policy checks, and generating fine-grained policies. 


      To use IAM Access Analyzer, users must first create an analyzer to
      identify potential risks and access issues. External access analyzers help
      identify resources with policies granting access to external principals,
      while unused access analyzers highlight unused IAM roles, access keys, and
      permissions. 


      IAM Access Analyzer also offers policy validation checks and the ability
      to refine permissions by generating policies based on CloudTrail logs.
      This guide outlines the various operations that can be performed
      programmatically with IAM Access Analyzer. For more information, refer to
      the IAM User Guide.

    description: >-
      <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API
      Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
      each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a
      private certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The
      documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the
      JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
      platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
      SDKs</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a
      quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per
      second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different
      rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web
      Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request
      exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When
      a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
      error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
      rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web
      Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your
      Amazon Web Services account and visit the <a

      <p>Use the Amazon Web Services Budgets API to plan your service usage,
      service costs, and instance reservations. This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for the Amazon Web Services Budgets feature. </p> <p>Budgets provide
      you with a way to see the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>How
      close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your
      Reserved Instances (RIs)</p> </li> <li> <p>Your current estimated charges
      from Amazon Web Services, and how much your predicted usage will accrue in
      charges by the end of the month</p> </li> <li> <p>How much of your budget
      has been used</p> </li> </ul> <p>Amazon Web Services updates your budget
      status several times a day. Budgets track your unblended costs,
      subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the following types of
      budgets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Cost budgets</b> - Plan how much you want to
      spend on a service.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Usage budgets</b> - Plan how
      much you want to use one or more services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>RI
      utilization budgets</b> - Define a utilization threshold, and receive
      alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see if
      your RIs are unused or under-utilized.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>RI coverage
      budgets</b> - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the
      number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below that
      threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by
      a reservation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Service Endpoint</p> <p>The Amazon Web

      Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that allows for
      seamless syncing of user data across multiple devices. With high-level
      client libraries available for iOS and Android, developers can easily
      persist data locally for offline access without the need to store
      credentials on the device. By using Amazon Cognito to obtain a unique user
      ID and credentials, developers can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs in
      datasets, with up to 20 datasets per user identity. Data stored with
      Amazon Cognito Sync is only accessible to the associated identity
      credentials. To use the Cognito Sync service, API calls must be made using
      credentials obtained from Amazon Cognito Identity service. For Android or
      iOS applications, developers can utilize the AWS Mobile SDK for API calls.
      For more information, refer to the Developer Guide for Android and the
      Developer Guide for iOS.

    description: >-
      Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that provides scoped
      temporary credentials for mobile devices and other untrusted environments.
      It offers consistent identity management for users throughout the lifespan
      of an application. With Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, developers
      can enable authentication with third-party identity providers like
      Facebook, Google, or Amazon, as well as with an Amazon Cognito user pool.
      Unauthenticated access from an app is also supported. Cognito generates a
      unique identifier for each user and serves as an OpenID token provider
      that is trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary
      AWS credentials with limited privileges. For a detailed explanation of the
      authentication process, refer to the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide's
      Authentication Flow section. More information about Amazon Cognito
      Federated Identities can be found on the official documentation.

    description: >-
      These APIs allow you to programmatically apply a library of predefined
      controls from Amazon Web Services to your organizational units. In Amazon
      Web Services Control Tower, the terms "control" and "guardrail" are
      interchangeable. To make API calls, you will need to know the
      controlIdentifier for the specific control you are targeting, the ARN
      associated with the target organizational unit (OU), referred to as the
      targetIdentifier, and the ARN associated with a resource you want to tag
      or untag.


      To obtain the controlIdentifier for your Amazon Web Services Control Tower
      control, each control has a unique ARN specified. You can locate the
      controlIdentifier in the console on the Control details page or in the
      documentation. The controlIdentifier is specific to each Amazon Web
      Services Region for each control and can be found in the Tables of control
      metadata in the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide.


      For the targetIdentifier, it is the ARN for an OU, which can be found in
      the Organizational unit details page in the Amazon Web Services
      Organizations console.


      For more information and examples, please refer to the following
      resources:

      - Control API input and output examples with CLI

      - Enabling controls with CloudFormation

      - Control metadata tables

      AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to
      exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to
      create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.
      As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an
      entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIs to download or
      copy your entitled data sets to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
      for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services.
      As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would
      like to publish to a product. Being able to package and provide your data
      sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more
      information, visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide. A data set is a
      collection of data that can be changed or updated over time. Data sets can
      be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or incremental
      change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An asset in
      AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an Amazon S3
      object, Redshift datashare, API Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation data
      permission, or Amazon S3 data access. The asset can be a structured data
      file, an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import
      or export operations used to create or copy assets.

    description: >-
      AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a
      pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring
      that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on
      processing the data. AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a
      task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task
      Runner provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as
      performing database queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic
      MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your
      task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide custom data
      management. AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality.
      Use the first set to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules,
      dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the
      second set in your task runner application to receive the next task ready
      for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying the
      data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to
      another, is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs the
      task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web
      service as it does so. When the task is done, the task runner reports the
      final success or failure of the task to the web service.

      <fullname>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service</fullname>
      <p>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application
      Discovery Service) helps you plan application migration projects. It
      automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
      dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see
      the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">Amazon Web
      Services Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>. </p> <p>Application
      Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting
      data about your on-premises servers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless
      discovery</b> using Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service
      Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to
      install an agent on each host.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Agentless Collector
      gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which
      minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
      assessment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agentless Collector doesn't collect
      information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery
      collects that information. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Agent-based discovery</b> using the Amazon Web Services Application
      Discovery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer set of
      data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts in
      your data center.</p> <ul> <li> <p> The agent captures infrastructure and
      application information, including an inventory of running processes,
      system performance information, resource utilization, and network
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information collected by agents is
      secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service
      database in the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-agent.html">Amazon
      Web Services Application Discovery Agent</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
      <ul> <li> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b>
      integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
      details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services
      Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or
      Application Discovery Agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application
      discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
      Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database
      using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data
      into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications
      with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows
      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use
      one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to
      the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
      information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
      Services SDKs</a>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Remember that you must set your
      Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
      associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a
      <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
      permitted outside of your home Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is
      unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs
      outside the home Region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
      returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to
      obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.</p> </li> </ul> </note>

      <p>All data is handled according to the <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">Amazon Web Services Privacy
      Policy</a>. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to

      Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to easily
      create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
      data on your snapshots, and identify differences or changes between two
      snapshots. Independent software vendors (ISVs) offering backup services
      for Amazon EBS can benefit from the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
      tracking incremental changes on Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots using
      these APIs. By creating incremental snapshots directly from on-premises
      data into volumes and the cloud, you can quickly enable disaster recovery.
      The ability to write and read snapshots allows you to write your
      on-premises data to a snapshot during a disaster and restore it back to
      Amazon Web Services or on-premises after recovery without the need for
      complex mechanisms. This API reference provides detailed information about
      actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For
      further information on the elements of the EBS direct APIs and effective
      use cases, refer to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

  - name: AWS Elastic Load Balancing
    description: >-
      Elastic Load Balancing is a feature that allows you to distribute incoming
      traffic across your EC2 instances, increasing the availability of your
      application. The load balancer monitors the health of registered instances
      and ensures that traffic is only routed to healthy instances. You can
      configure your load balancer by specifying listeners that determine how
      traffic is accepted, including protocols and port numbers. Elastic Load
      Balancing offers three types of load balancers - Application Load
      Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers - so you can
      choose the one that best suits your application needs. For more
      information, please refer to the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide. The
      API documentation covers the 2012-06-01 API for Classic Load Balancers,
      while the 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network
      Load Balancers. To begin using Elastic Load Balancing, create a load
      balancer with listeners using CreateLoadBalancer and register your
      instances using RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer. All operations in
      Elastic Load Balancing are idempotent, meaning they only complete once and
      will succeed if repeated with a 200 OK response code.

  - name: Global Accelerator
    description: >-
      Global Accelerator is a powerful API service that allows developers to
      create accelerators to enhance the performance of their applications for
      both local and global users. This API Reference provides detailed
      information on Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors,
      catering to developers looking to leverage Global Accelerator features.


      Global Accelerator offers two types of accelerators - standard and custom
      routing. With a standard accelerator, traffic is directed to optimal
      endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network, improving
      availability for internet applications used by a global audience. On the
      other hand, a custom routing accelerator allows developers to map users to
      specific endpoints using application logic.


      Global Accelerator is a global service supporting endpoints in multiple
      Amazon Web Services Regions, with the US West (Oregon) Region being the
      default for creating, updating, and managing accelerators. The API
      provides static IP addresses, anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge
      network, with two static IPv4 addresses for standard accelerators and four
      addresses for dual-stack accelerators.


      Standard accelerators distribute incoming application traffic across
      various endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions, such
      as Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2
      instances, or Elastic IP addresses. Custom routing accelerators map
      traffic arriving at static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in
      virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.


      Static IP addresses remain assigned to accelerators even if disabled, but
      are lost upon deletion. IAM policies, including tag-based permissions, can
      be used to control accelerator deletion permissions.


      Global Accelerator utilizes the Amazon Web Services global network to
      route traffic to optimal regional endpoints based on health, client
      location, and configured policies. The service reacts instantly to changes
      in health or configuration to ensure continuous, efficient traffic routing
      for clients.

  - name: AWS Health
    description: >-
      The Health API grants access to Health information displayed in the Health
      Dashboard. Users can utilize API operations to retrieve data on events
      that may impact their Amazon Web Services and resources. A Business,
      Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from Amazon Web Services
      Support is required to access the Health API. Attempting to use the API
      without the appropriate plan will result in a
      SubscriptionRequiredException error. Access to the API necessitates an
      access key ID and secret access key, with a recommendation to utilize
      temporary credentials over long-term access keys when feasible. Temporary
      credentials encompass an access key ID, secret access key, and security
      token indicating expiration. The Health API endpoint
      health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) can be accessed to call API
      operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture with
      two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. The high
      availability endpoint example can be utilized to identify the active
      Amazon Web Services Region for obtaining the most current information.
      Authentication for requests is carried out using the Signature Version 4
      Signing Process. Users with accounts under Organizations can leverage the
      Health organizational view feature for a centralized view of Health events
      across all accounts in the organization. This allows for real-time
      aggregation of events to identify affected accounts or be notified of
      security vulnerabilities. By using the organizational view API operations,
      users can enable this feature and retrieve event information.
      Recommendations when utilizing the Health API for returning Health events
      include specifying the eventScopeCode parameter to determine the type of
      Health events to return (public or account-specific) and utilizing
      pagination to view all response events, particularly when using operations
      like DescribeEventsForOrganization to retrieve events across the
      organization.

    description: >-
      Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet
      issues impact the performance and availability between your applications
      hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can reduce the time
      it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to minutes.
      Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services
      captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a baseline of
      performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the same data
      that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and availability.
      With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness
      for you when there are significant problems for your end users in the
      different geographic locations where your application runs. Internet
      Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch
      Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health information
      for geographies and networks specific to your application. Internet
      Monitor sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up
      notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network,
      you also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard
      notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate
      the problem. To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and associate
      your application's resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront
      distributions, or WorkSpaces directories - so Internet Monitor can
      determine where your application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor

      IoT Analytics is a powerful tool designed to streamline the collection,
      processing, storage, and analysis of large amounts of device data. This
      API allows users to easily query and run sophisticated analytics on IoT
      data, enabling advanced exploration and visualization through integration
      with Jupyter Notebooks and Amazon QuickSight. Traditional analytics tools
      are often ill-equipped to handle the noisy and messy data generated by IoT
      devices, which can contain gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings.
      IoT Analytics automates the cleaning and enrichment of IoT data before
      storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. Users can customize
      the data collection process, apply mathematical transforms, and enrich
      data with device-specific metadata for more meaningful insights. The API
      also offers built-in models for common IoT use cases, empowering users to
      make informed decisions based on predictive analytics and machine learning
      inference.

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      real-time API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS
      EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and
      responses, including errors. </p> <p>Terminology:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A
      <i>stage</i> is a virtual space where participants can exchange video in
      real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <i>participant token</i> is a token that
      authenticates a participant when they join a stage.</p> </li> <li> <p>A
      <i>participant object</i> represents participants (people) in the stage
      and contains information about them. When a token is created, it includes
      a participant ID; when a participant uses that token to join a stage, the
      participant is associated with that participant ID. There is a 1:1 mapping
      between participant tokens and participants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server-side
      composition: The <i>composition</i> process composites participants of a
      stage into a single video and forwards it to a set of outputs (e.g., IVS
      channels). Composition endpoints support this process.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Server-side composition: A <i>composition</i> controls the look of the
      outputs, including how participants are positioned in the video.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain
      information about your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/RealTimeUserGuide/getting-started.html">Getting
      Started with Amazon IVS Real-Time Streaming</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Stage</b> — A stage is a virtual space where participants can exchange
      video in real time.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A
      <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
      comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example,
      you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular
      video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS stages has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS real-time API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resource supports tagging:
      Stage.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.</p> <p>

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API
      enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need
      to integrate with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">
      Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API</a>, to enable users to interact with chat
      rooms in real time.</p> <p>The API is an AWS regional service. For a list
      of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the
      Amazon IVS Chat information on the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>Notes on
      terminology:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>You create service applications using
      the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as <i>applications</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>You create front-end client applications (browser and
      Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to
      these as <i>clients</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The
      following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>LoggingConfiguration</b> — A configuration that allows customers to
      store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging
      Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Room</b> — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients
      connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a
      metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a
      <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set
      a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category.
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:
      <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>.
      The following resource supports tagging: Room.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can
      be applied to a resource.</p> <p> <b>API Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your
      Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be
      authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
      IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
      create using the <a>CreateChatToken</a> endpoint through the AWS SDK. You
      call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and
      authorization information about the user.</p> <p> <b>Signing API
      Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4
      signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line
      Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API
      calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP
      API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You
      generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has
      permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage
      requests must be made using an IAM role that has the
      <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For more
      information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures —
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p>
      <b>Messaging Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMessage</a> — Sends
      an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific
      message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s
      chat history. This event’s <code>EventName</code> is
      <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html">
      DeleteMessage</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectUser</a> — Disconnects all
      connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html">
      DisconnectUser</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>SendEvent</a> — Sends an event to a room. Use
      this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of
      a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is
      rendered.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chat Token Endpoint</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <a>CreateChatToken</a> — Creates an encrypted token that is used by a
      chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a
      room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid
      for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes
      invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.</p>
      </li> </ul> <p> <b>Room Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateRoom</a>
      — Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.</p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteRoom</a> — Deletes the specified room.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetRoom</a> — Gets the specified room.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListRooms</a> — Gets summary information about all your rooms in the
      AWS region where the API request is processed. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdateRoom</a> — Updates a room’s configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Logging Configuration Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Creates a logging configuration that
      allows clients to store and record sent messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteLoggingConfiguration</a> — Deletes the specified logging
      configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetLoggingConfiguration</a> — Gets
      the specified logging configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListLoggingConfigurations</a> — Gets summary information about all your
      logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is
      processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Updates
      a specified logging configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tags
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a> — Gets
      information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>TagResource</a> — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the
      specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UntagResource</a> — Removes tags from
      the resource with the specified ARN.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All the above are
      HTTP operations. There is a separate <i>messaging</i> API for managing
      Chat resources; see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">

    description: >-
      <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service
      (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide
      describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
      general information about KMS, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key
      Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has
      replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and
      <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes,
      KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services
      provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
      programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android,
      etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
      KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take
      care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
      retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web
      Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
      </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make
      programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2
      validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web
      Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services
      Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service
      endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web
      Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed
      and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends
      you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support
      cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).
      Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p>
      <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access
      key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use
      your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key
      for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for
      an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate
      temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All
      KMS requests must be signed with <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports
      CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related
      events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon
      S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
      CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
      request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
      including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more
      information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html">Amazon
      Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general
      information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web
      Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a

      process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access
      key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of
      the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the
      most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations
      other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using
      the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>

      <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your

      retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch
      console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon
      Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.</p> <p>You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Monitor logs from EC2
      instances in real time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor
      applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can
      track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it
      can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
      threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for
      monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor
      application logs for specific literal terms (such as
      "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of
      a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status
      codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is
      found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
      specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You
      can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular
      API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to
      perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage.
      You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier
      than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent
      helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
      and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you
      need it.</p> </li> </ul>

      vision to identify missing components in an industrial product, damage to
      vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even
      minuscule defects in silicon wafers — or any other physical item where
      quality is important such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit

      API.</p> <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data
      for custom usage dimensions.</p> <p>For information on the permissions you
      need to use this API, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
      Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS
      Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> </p> <p> <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
      </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>MeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for an
      AWS Marketplace product. <code>MeterUsage</code> is called from an EC2
      instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>BatchMeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for a set of
      customers. <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Accepting
      New Customers</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>ResolveCustomer</i> - Called by a
      SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
      website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration
      Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this
      API to obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the
      <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b> </p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace
      must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
      <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation for software entitlement and
      metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
      required to call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you can do so if you want
      to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on
      using the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
      Products</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> API calls
      are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the
      SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records
      with the <code>eventName</code> of <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>. You can
      also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see
      the <i> <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS

      <p>This is the <i>AWS HealthImaging API Reference</i>. AWS HealthImaging
      is a HIPAA-eligible service that helps health care providers and their
      medical imaging ISV partners store, transform, and apply machine learning
      to medical images. For an introduction to the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/healthimaging/latest/devguide/what-is.html">
      <i>AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>We recommend
      using one of the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) for your programming
      language, as they take care of request authentication, serialization, and
      connection management. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools">Tools to build on
      AWS</a>.</p> <p>For information about using HealthImaging API actions in
      one of the language-specific AWS SDKs, refer to the <i>See Also</i> link
      at the end of each section that describes an API action or data type.</p>
      </note> <p>The following sections list AWS HealthImaging API actions
      categorized according to functionality. Links are provided to actions

      <note> <p>This guide is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage
      resources in MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from May 2023. To get
      started with MediaPackage v2, create your MediaPackage resources. There
      isn't an automated process to migrate your resources from MediaPackage v1
      to MediaPackage v2. </p> <p>The names of the entities that you use to
      access this API, like URLs and ARNs, all have the versioning information

      or the MediaPackage v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1 resources.</p>
      <p>If you created resources in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand (VOD)
      workflows, and aren't looking to migrate to MediaPackage v2 yet, see the
      <a

      MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It describes all the MediaPackage
      API operations for live content in detail, and provides sample requests,
      responses, and errors for the supported web services protocols.</p> <p>We
      assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use MediaPackage
      via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the features
      and operations of MediaPackage, as described in the AWS Elemental
      MediaPackage User Guide.</p>

      <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the
      resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example,
      you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
      instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
      additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data
      to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to
      monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you
      can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
      visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
      operational health.</p>

      Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine
      optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph
      with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models
      Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache

      Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line
      interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune
      is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
      such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been
      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
      maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list

      <p>This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API
      actions, data types, and errors. </p> <ul> <li> <p>The REST API requires
      you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling
      request retries, and error handling. For general information about using
      the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon
      Web Services APIs</a>. </p> <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST
      API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com
      </code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon
      Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming
      language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and
      step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall
      console, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network
      Firewall Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Network Firewall is a
      stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention
      service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network
      Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
      includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway,
      NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules
      that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis
      and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version
      6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a
      href="https://suricata.io/">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use
      Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of
      ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow
      domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints,
      such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain
      names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep
      packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS,
      regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall
      for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network
      Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User
      Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p>
      <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to
      protect, create it in Amazon VPC. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, in
      each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create
      a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p> </li> <li> <p>In
      Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the
      components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your
      firewall to have. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a
      firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional
      default traffic filtering behavior. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network
      Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC
      subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that
      you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route
      traffic through the new firewall endpoints.</p> </li> </ol>

      <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname> <p>AWS OpsWorks for configuration
      management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration
      management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS
      OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers,
      and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of
      terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management
      server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server
      runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use
      various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service
      (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over
      the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In
      AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create
      servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you
      want to use. Valid values in this release include
      <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the
      configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for
      backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of
      a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup
      starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a
      server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run,
      when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When
      you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are
      assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store
      information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your
      customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS
      OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect
      to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or
      managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li>

      requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.</p>

      <i>Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference</i>. This guide provides
      information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including
      supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.</p> <p> <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> is an AWS
      service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple
      messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text
      messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint
      Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the
      email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint
      API.</p> <p>If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to
      also review the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon
      Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i>
      provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to
      use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon
      Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications.
      The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon
      Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to
      using the service.</p> <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in
      several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions.
      For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently
      available, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS
      Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.

      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing
      AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
      <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
      Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united
      by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network
      connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high
      levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To
      learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in
      each Region, see <a

      <p>This is the Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions,
      syntax and usage examples for each of the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">actions</a>
      and <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html">data
      types</a> for the Proton service.</p> <p>The documentation for each action
      shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an
      API. For more information, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon
      Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide</a>.</p> <p>The Proton
      service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create
      service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment
      tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in
      turn, select from the available service templates to automate their
      application or service deployments.</p> <p>Because administrators define
      the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need
      permissions to use all of the listed API operations.</p> <p>When
      developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton
      deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running
      on Proton, developers need permissions to the service <i>create</i>,
      <i>list</i>, <i>update</i> and <i>delete</i> API operations and the
      service instance <i>list</i> and <i>update</i> API operations.</p> <p>To
      learn more about Proton, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">Proton
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b> </p> <p>When you make
      a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the
      asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might
      also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete,
      even if the request already returned a result. This might make it
      difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might
      need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation
      completes successfully. However, if the original request and the
      subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times.
      This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p>
      <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more
      than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action
      completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully
      without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain
      updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The
      following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure
      idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b>
      </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a
      <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands
      also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique,
      case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent
      API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the
      request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token
      for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these
      APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p>
      <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry
      succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the
      original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are
      different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens
      expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with
      the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original
      resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is
      created.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent
      create APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
      <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original
      resource <i>hasn't</i> been modified, the retry succeeds without
      performing any further actions other than returning the original resource
      detail data in the response.</p> <p>If the original resource has been
      modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p> <p>If you
      retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a
      <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Idempotent create
      APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li>
      <p>CreateServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironment</p> </li>
      <li> <p>CreateService</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b>
      </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry
      the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its
      metadata is returned in the response.</p> <p>If you retry and the resource
      doesn't exist, the response is empty.</p> <p>In both cases, the retry
      succeeds.</p> <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li>
      <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>DeleteServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li>
      <p>DeleteServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>
      <p>DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Asynchronous
      idempotent delete APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has
      succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, if
      the original request delete operation status is
      <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource detail
      data in the response without performing any further actions.</p> <p>If the
      original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty
      response.</p> <p>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li>

      decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
      at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.</p>

      <p>The Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient
      way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products,
      and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses
      standardized product attributes such as <code>Location</code>,
      <code>Storage Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and
      provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services
      Price List to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Build cost control and
      scenario planning tools</p> </li> <li> <p>Reconcile billing data</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Forecast future spend for budgeting purposes</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with
      Amazon Web Services</p> </li> </ul> <p>Use <code>GetServices</code>
      without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all Amazon Web
      Services, then <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retrieve
      the attribute names for that service. After you have the service code and
      attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code> to see what
      values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an
      attribute name and value, you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find
      specific products that you're interested in, such as an
      <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a <code>Provisioned IOPS</code>
      <code>volumeType</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

      <p>The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB</p> <note> <p>Instead of

      the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on a ledger.</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The driver
      provides a high-level abstraction layer above this <i>QLDB Session</i>

      information and a list of supported programming languages, see <a

      started with the driver</a> in the <i>Amazon QLDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS
      CLI), use the QLDB shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses
      the QLDB driver to interact with a ledger. For information, see <a

      <fullname>Amazon Redshift</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is
      an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for
      one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage
      Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which
      means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or
      asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been
      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
      next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster
      management interfaces, go to <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using
      the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.</p> <p>Amazon Redshift
      manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data
      warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster,
      and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can
      focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and
      customers.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we
      recommend that you begin by reading the <a

      <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and
      discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your
      resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of
      resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
      instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon
      DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata
      like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the
      Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service
      on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p> <p>Resource Explorer
      scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your
      Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer.
      Resource Explorer <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
      and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that
      Region's resources.</p> <p>You can <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search
      across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one
      of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for
      the account. When you <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote
      a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the
      account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index
      information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator
      index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all
      resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on
      Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region
      include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.</p>
      <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer,
      including how to enable and configure the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon

      <p>Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
      your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run
      outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services
      credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you
      have for native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web
      Services resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage
      long-term credentials for workloads running outside of Amazon Web
      Services.</p> <p> To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509
      certificates issued by their certificate authority (CA). You register the
      CA with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between
      your public key infrastructure (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't
      manage your own PKI system, you can use Private Certificate Authority to
      create a CA and then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere.
      </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you
      can call programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere,

      <p>Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as
      Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
      databases, and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using
      criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of
      resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share
      one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources
      based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,
      regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups
      enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in Amazon Web
      Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in
      Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let
      you quickly view a custom console in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager

      <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide
      for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53
      ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover
      applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web
      Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a
      highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five
      redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or
      update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one
      routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one
      Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be
      aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you
      work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states
      in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon)
      Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter
      <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
      Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon
      Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API
      guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and
      update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing
      control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components
      (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery
      cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with
      routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li>

      <p>When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS
      resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver
      answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2
      instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs
      recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
      names.</p> <p>You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and
      your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:</p> <p> <b>Forward
      DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b> </p>
      <p>DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
      specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain
      names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records
      in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc">How
      DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Conditionally
      forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b> </p> <p>You
      can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
      instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward
      selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names
      for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and
      the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to
      forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com,
      acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match
      (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you
      specified in that rule. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network">How
      Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Like Amazon VPC,
      Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose
      whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound
      queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.</p>

      <p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
      provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the
      runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For
      example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to
      Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user
      request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the
      bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to
      elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust
      type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when
      you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your
      Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time
      API, . </p>

      Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of
      data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
      associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB
      provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A
      traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
      capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
      repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically
      simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and
      providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates
      the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
      performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within
      Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and
      pay only for what they use. </p> <p> Visit <a

      <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers
      and enterprises to quickly find
       and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
       see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of 
       all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category 
       keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. 
       You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, 
       configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
       within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
       AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
       code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
       For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
       GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
       experiences available:</p><ul>
       <li>
       <p>Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including
       source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. </p>
       <p>Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other
       developers, and publish new versions of applications. </p>

      <p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You
      can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from
      cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in
      your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an
      account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web
      Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally
      manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite
      existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you
      analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security
      posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the
      protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p> <p>The data lake
      is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you
      retain ownership over your data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates
      with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a
      user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake,
      CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls
      captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to
      the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
      continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including
      events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still
      view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history.
      Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the
      request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the
      request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional
      details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon
      Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the
      collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon
      Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the
      lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings.
      Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a
      standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
      (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can
      subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response
      and security data analytics.</p>

      automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues.
      For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical
      findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the
      integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to
      specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API
      Reference</i>, provides information about the Security Hub API. This
      includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If
      you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
      <i>Security Hub User Guide</i> </a>. The user guide explains key concepts
      and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features.
      It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub
      with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with
      Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a
      current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon
      Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
      code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go,
      Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient,
      programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They
      also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
      requests automatically. For information about installing and using the
      Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
      Services</a>.</p> <p>With the exception of operations that are related to
      central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the
      Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
      Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any
      configuration or settings change that results from the operation is
      applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions,
      call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the
      change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling
      Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and
      all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central
      configuration terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User
      Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub
      API operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of
      1 request per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>GetFindings</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second. <code>BurstLimit</code>

      <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console
      designed to help users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their
      Amazon Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any unplanned
      interruption or reduction in quality of services.</p> <p>Incident Manager
      increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
      highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration
      tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of
      reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager
      automates response plans and enables responder team escalation.</p>

      <fullname>Step Functions</fullname> <p>Step Functions is a service that
      lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and
      microservices using visual workflows.</p> <p>You can use Step Functions to
      build applications from individual components, each of which performs a
      discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change
      applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
      visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
      Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps
      when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the
      right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you
      can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.</p> <p>Step Functions manages
      operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is
      available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own
      servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can
      access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the
      <i> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">Step
      Functions Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p> <important> <p>If you use the Step
      Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make
      sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal
      case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action
      <code>startSyncExecution</code> and specify its parameter as
      <code>StateMachineArn</code>.</p> </important>

      <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
      a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM
      Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s
      access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM
      Identity Center.</p> <note> <p>IAM Identity Center uses the
      <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces.</p>
      </note> <p> <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you
      begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
      important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service
      works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently
      implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
      standard (<a
      href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)
      that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.
      </p> </li> <li> <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits
      OIDC access tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
      re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh and
      doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI version
      (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token
      refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure
      Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p> </li> <li>
      <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon
      Web Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user,
      not just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in
      this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token
      into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with
      IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a>
      in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
      is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User

      volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing
      to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and

      <p>Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management service from
      Amazon Web Services. You can use Verified Permissions to manage
      permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those
      permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant
      access based on information about the users, resources, and requested
      actions. You can also evaluate additional information like group
      membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time
      of request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these
      permissions by letting you create and store authorization policies for
      your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise
      business systems.</p> <p>Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy
      language to express your permission requirements. Cedar supports both
      role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
      authorization models.</p> <p>For more information about configuring,
      administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your applications,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Verified Permissions User Guide</a>.</p> <p>For more information about the
      Cedar policy language, see the <a
      href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/">Cedar Policy Language Guide</a>.</p>
      <important> <p>When you write Cedar policies that reference principals,
      resources and actions, you can define the unique identifiers used for each
      of those elements. We strongly recommend that you follow these best
      practices:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Use values like universally unique
      identifiers (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.</b> </p>
      <p>For example, if user <code>jane</code> leaves the company, and you
      later let someone else use the name <code>jane</code>, then that new user
      automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still
      reference <code>User::"jane"</code>. Cedar can’t distinguish between the
      new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource
      identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never
      reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of
      the presence of an old identifier in a policy.</p> <p>Where you use a UUID
      for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment
      specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your
      policies easier to understand. For example: principal ==
      User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111", // alice</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive
      information as part of the unique identifier for your principals or
      resources.</b> These identifiers are included in log entries shared in
      CloudTrail trails.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <p>Several operations
      return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes. As new
      functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter
      of one operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense
      for the same parameter in a different operation. To help you understand
      the purpose of each, the following naming convention is used for the
      structures:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in
      <code>Detail</code> are used in <code>Get</code> operations.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Item</code> are used
      in <code>List</code> operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter type
      structures that use neither suffix are used in the mutating (create and
      update) operations.</p> </li> </ul>

      <fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the
      <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that
      you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the
      versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the
      prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version,
      because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used
      WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF
      resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web
      ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF
      Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
      </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to
      this version, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall
      that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an
      Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application
      Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner
      service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets
      you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services
      resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify,
      such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of
      query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the
      requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom
      response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed
      information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed
      information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed
      in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF
      endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you
      can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an
      Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an
      AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service,
      or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For
      Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for
      US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you
      can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's
      tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
      more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon
      Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF
      API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API
      provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following
      major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and
      regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you
      specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to
      <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You
      can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with
      a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass
      them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF
      places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each
      type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the
      maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>

      <p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to
      internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single
      step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as
      efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in
      their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email.
      Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user's access and securely renders
      authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS
      cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content
      on mobile devices.</p>

      <p>WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service
      with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access
      your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser,
      or other native iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate
      WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control both the keys
      that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.</p>
      <p>The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>Listing and describing organizations</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
      <p>Managing users</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Managing groups</p> </li>
      </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Managing resources</p> </li> </ul> <p>All WorkMail API
      operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only
      require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
      AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
      access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an
      IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
      administrative visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set
      in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to
      create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows
      developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users
      the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.</p>

      <p>The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for
      users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises
      file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory
      structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as
      modifications to the permissions of files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security:
      Support security applications are supported for users who have additional
      security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
      actions, along with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
      changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the
      necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates
      the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are
      supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose
      to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with
      CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical
      applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are
      Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use
      of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
      IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
      policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon
      WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the
      entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes,
      but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload
      any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use
      cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a
      selective basis using the IAM model.</p> <note> <p>The pricing for Amazon
      WorkDocs APIs varies depending on the API call type for these actions:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <code>READ (Get*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WRITE
      (Activate*, Add*, Create*, Deactivate*, Initiate*, Update*)</code> </p>
      </li> <li> <p> <code>LIST (Describe*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>DELETE*, CANCEL</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about
